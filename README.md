# CircuitGeneratorandSimulator

#### Project for Computer Architecture Class

This program can create logic gates and link them together to create a circuit. It supports Combinational Circuit and Sequential Circuits. However, the Sequential Circuit is a bit buggy sometimes it works depending on how the circuit was constructed.

There's probably a bit of repetitive code since I was on a time crunch trying to push this out. Not sure if I want to fix it up or be content with this. Thanks for checking this out!
