# CircuitGeneratorandSimulator

#### Project for Computer Architecture Class

This program can create logic gates and link them together to create a circuit. It supports Combinational Circuit and Sequential Circuits. However, the Sequential Circuit is a bit buggy sometimes it works depending on how the circuit was constructed.

There's probably a bit of repetitive code since I was on a time crunch trying to push this out. Thanks for checking this out!

Issues to Fix:
- Function return instead of calling menu method / other methods to solve for stack overflow.
- Execute D Flip Flop after all gates has been executed to solve for the Sequential Circuit construction issue.
